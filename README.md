"Raisin' a kid? We got you."

K-8 childcare app for teachers and caretakers

Focusing on:

- Best practices for Typescript and React
- Cross-platform UI development (for web and app)

Current Stack:
- React-Native
- TS
- Expo

TO-DO:

**Bugs**
- [ ] Edit profile modal not working on button press
- [ ] List of instructors needs to update for raisins after kid is added to classroom

**General**
- [ ] Better log-in screen (only show buttons to log in as raisin/instructor to start then show dashboard button)
- [ ] Change age to automatically be calculated, remove from modal (or do we include it at all?)
- [ ] Move any editing (create child, edit info, remove from classroom etc.) to hamburger menu
- [ ] More user-friendly log (raw logs should still be accessible in a history tab or something)
- [ ] Start using a database (PostgreSQL?)
- [ ] **Make a real UI**
- [ ] Testing

*Extra* (these will probably not be fully functional but it would be nice to design them)
- [ ] Make a profile page
- [ ] Make a messaging page
- [ ] Make a calendar page

<H2> Screencaps </H2> (mobile storage is separate from web storage right now thats why certain attributes are different)
